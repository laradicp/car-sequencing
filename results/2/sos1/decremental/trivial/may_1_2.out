Retaining values of one MIP start for possible repair.
Found incumbent of value 0.000000 after 0.00 sec. (0.01 ticks)
Tried aggregator 3 times.
MIP Presolve eliminated 27 rows and 24 columns.
MIP Presolve added 4 rows and 1 columns.
MIP Presolve modified 2 coefficients.
Aggregator did 4 substitutions.
All rows and columns eliminated.
Presolve time = 0.00 sec. (0.05 ticks)

Root node processing (before b&c):
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.06 ticks)
Sequential b&c:
  Real time             =    0.00 sec. (0.00 ticks)
